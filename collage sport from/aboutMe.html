        <p>
            I am Bikram Pal, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Information Technology from Bankura Unnayani Institute of Engineering. I hail from Jhagrapur village, under Satyayatan Post Office, located in Bankura district, West Bengal (PIN: 722139).<br><br>

            My educational journey began at Jhagrapur Prathomik School, where I completed Classes 1 to 4. I then moved on to Jhagrapur Junior High School for Classes 5 to 8. My secondary education was completed at Chhatna Chandidas Vidyapith, where I studied from Class 9 to 12.<br><br>

            Due to the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, I did not appear for the Class 10 board examinations. However, I was awarded a percentage of 76.6% based on internal assessments. Opting for the science stream, I completed my Class 12 in 2021, securing a percentage of 59%.<br><br>

            I consider myself an average student, but I am always eager to improve, learn, and grow. I have a strong passion for creative expression and sports. Drawing has always been a favorite outlet for me, allowing me to explore various ideas and emotions through art. Additionally, I am an enthusiastic follower and player of cricket, which brings me immense joy and excitement.<br><br>

            During my time at Chhatna Chandidas Vidyapith, I was actively involved in the National Cadet Corps (NCC) from Class 9 to 10. My involvement in NCC helped me cultivate values like discipline, leadership, and teamwork. I am proud to have earned my NCC 'A' certificate, which remains one of the highlights of my personal development journey.<br><br>

            As I continue my academic and personal pursuits, I remain committed to bettering myself each day â€” with curiosity, passion, and a dedication to continuous learning.
